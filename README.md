# Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression
This is the GitHub repository for Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression: A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to assess the varying importance of compositional predictors across spatial locations within a nonparametric Bayesian framework.
# Simulation Results
The simulation codes in the paper are included in the "Simulation" file. 
Simulation 1: Cluster setting 1+Parameter setting 1.
Simulation 2: Cluster setting 2+Parameter setting 1.
Simualtion 3: Cluster setting 1+Parameter setting 2.
Simulation 4: Cluster setting 2+Parameter setting 2.
We first use "Model selection" code to select the best lambda. Then the best lambda will be apllied to the simulation code.
