# Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression
This is the GitHub repository for Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression: A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to assess the varying importance of compositional predictors across spatial locations within a nonparametric Bayesian framework.
